# Calculator-App
This is a simple console-based calculator application written in Java. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application demonstrates method overloading for the addition function, allowing it to handle different numbers of arguments and data types.

Features
Addition: Add two or three integers, or two double-precision floating-point numbers.

Subtraction: Subtract one integer from another.

Multiplication: Multiply two double-precision floating-point numbers.

Division: Divide one integer by another, with a check for division by zero.

Interactive Menu: A user-friendly command-line interface guides the user through the operations.

How to Run the Application
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

Code Structure
The application consists of three main classes:

**Calculator:** This class contains the core logic for the arithmetic operations. It includes overloaded **add()** methods to handle different types of input.

**UserInterface:** This class manages user input and output, displaying the main menu and calling the appropriate methods from the **Calculator** class.

**CalculatorApp:** This is the main class with the **main** method, which serves as the entry point of the application.
